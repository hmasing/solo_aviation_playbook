# Pre-Flight Briefing and Checklist Execution

Conduct pre-flight briefings and checklist execution to ensure safe and effective flight training sessions with proper preparation and risk management.

## Purpose

Establish procedures for conducting thorough pre-flight briefings and systematic checklist execution to ensure students and instructors are properly prepared for flight training activities and understand safety procedures and training objectives.

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Flight Instructor:**

- Conduct student assessments and training
- Review training objectives with students
- Coordinate aircraft scheduling for training
- Maintain communication with students on progress
- Ensure safety and regulatory compliance

**Chief Flight Instructor:**

- Review student qualifications and training goals
- Assign appropriate flight instructors based on needs
- Conduct flight school orientation and safety briefings
- Approve training program selection and scheduling
- Ensure Part 61 compliance for all training operations
## Process Steps

### Pre-Flight Planning Phase

- **Review training objectives** - Confirm lesson goals and specific maneuvers or procedures to be practiced
- **Assess weather conditions** - Analyze current and forecast weather for flight safety and training suitability
- **Plan flight route** - Determine training area, airports, and navigation requirements for planned activities
- **Review aircraft status** - Verify aircraft airworthiness, fuel status, and equipment availability

### Safety Briefing Phase

- **Conduct safety briefing** - Review emergency procedures, risk factors, and safety considerations for planned flight
- **Review emergency procedures** - Discuss engine failures, emergency landings, and other critical emergency responses
- **Assess risk factors** - Identify and discuss weather, terrain, traffic, and other operational risks
- **Establish communication procedures** - Review radio procedures, air traffic control coordination, and emergency communications

### Aircraft Inspection Phase

- **Execute pre-flight inspection** - Conduct systematic aircraft inspection using approved checklist procedures
- **Review aircraft systems** - Verify proper operation of engine, electrical, and flight control systems
- **Check fuel and oil** - Confirm adequate fuel quantity and oil levels for planned flight duration
- **Document inspection results** - Record any discrepancies and coordinate maintenance actions if required

### Final Preparation Phase

- **Complete cockpit preparation** - Configure aircraft systems, radios, and navigation equipment for departure
- **Review lesson plan** - Confirm training sequence and coordinate with air traffic control as needed
- **Conduct final safety check** - Verify all safety items completed and authorize flight training commencement
- **Brief passenger procedures** - Review safety procedures for any passengers accompanying training flight

## Tools and Resources

**Briefing Materials:**

- Weather information systems and forecasting resources
- Aeronautical charts and navigation publications
- Aircraft operating handbooks and checklists
- Emergency procedure reference cards and training materials

**Inspection Equipment:**

- Aircraft-specific pre-flight inspection checklists
- Inspection tools and equipment (flashlight, fuel tester, etc.)
- Aircraft logbooks and maintenance records
- Communication equipment for coordination with maintenance and operations

**Planning Resources:**

- Flight planning software and navigation tools
- Airport and airspace information resources
- Risk assessment and decision-making tools
- Training syllabus and lesson plan materials

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Pre-flight briefing and inspection completed within 45 minutes of scheduled departure.
**Quality Standard:** 100% of required briefing items covered and documented for each training flight.
**Safety Standard:** All safety-related discrepancies identified and resolved before flight authorization.
**Client Satisfaction:** Students demonstrate understanding of briefing content and feel prepared for training flight.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Rushed pre-flight briefings due to schedule pressures affecting thoroughness
**Solution:** Allocate adequate time for briefings and emphasize safety priority over schedule adherence

**Issue:** Students unprepared for briefing content or lacking understanding of procedures
**Solution:** Provide pre-briefing study materials and require demonstration of knowledge before flight activities

**Issue:** Weather or aircraft conditions requiring flight cancellation after briefing completion
**Solution:** Maintain flexible scheduling and use cancelled flight time for additional ground instruction

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Never authorize flight training activities if weather conditions, aircraft status, or student preparedness present safety risks

⚡ **CAUTION**: Ensure all pre-flight inspection items are completed thoroughly and any discrepancies are resolved before flight

ℹ️ **NOTE**: Pre-flight briefings must be tailored to student experience level and specific training objectives

✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Use pre-flight briefings as teaching opportunities to reinforce safety culture and decision-making skills
