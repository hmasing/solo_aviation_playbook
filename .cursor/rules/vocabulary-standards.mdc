# FBO Vocabulary Standards

## Organizational Terminology
Inspired by Rocket Mortgage and Quicken Loans' ISMs, use these terms consistently throughout all FBO procedures to reflect our values and culture:

**Core Relationships:**
- **Clients**: Individuals or organizations we serve (never "customers")
- **Team Members**: Individuals employed within our organization (never "employees" or "staff")
- **Leaders**: Individuals in supervisory or management roles who guide and develop team members (never "managers" or "supervisors")
- **Partners**: External entities, vendors, or organizations we collaborate with
- **Guests**: Visitors to our facility who are not clients (passengers, crew members, observers)

**Operational Language:**
- **Opportunities**: Challenges, problems, or situations that present potential for improvement
- **Solutions**: Innovative responses, procedures, or strategies developed to address opportunities
- **Initiatives**: Projects, programs, or systematic efforts undertaken to achieve specific goals
- **Excellence**: Our standard approach to all operations (not "good enough" or "adequate")

**Growth and Development:**
- **Feedback**: Constructive insights or suggestions aimed at fostering improvement
- **Recognition**: Acknowledgment and appreciation of team members' contributions
- **Development**: Continuous learning and growth opportunities for team members
- **Engagement**: Active participation and commitment in organizational activities

**Service Philosophy:**
- **Experience**: What we create for clients (not just "service")
- **Commitment**: Our promise and dedication to excellence
- **Innovation**: Creative approaches to improving operations and client experience
- **Accountability**: Individual and collective responsibility for outcomes
