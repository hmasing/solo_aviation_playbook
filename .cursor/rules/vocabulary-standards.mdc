# Solo Aviation Services Vocabulary Standards

## Organizational Terminology
Inspired by Rocket Mortgage and Quicken Loans' ISMs, use these terms consistently throughout all FBO procedures to reflect our values and culture:

**Core Relationships:**
- **Clients**: Individuals or organizations we serve (never "customers")
- **Team Members**: Individuals employed within our organization (never "employees" or "staff")
- **Leaders**: Individuals in supervisory or management roles who guide and develop team members (never "managers" or "supervisors")
- **Partners**: External entities, vendors, or organizations we collaborate with
- **Guests**: Visitors to our facility who are not clients (passengers, crew members, observers)

**Operational Language:**
- **Opportunities**: Challenges, problems, or situations that present potential for improvement
- **Solutions**: Innovative responses, procedures, or strategies developed to address opportunities
- **Initiatives**: Projects, programs, or systematic efforts undertaken to achieve specific goals
- **Excellence**: Our standard approach to all operations (not "good enough" or "adequate")

**Growth and Development:**
- **Feedback**: Constructive insights or suggestions aimed at fostering improvement
- **Recognition**: Acknowledgment and appreciation of team members' contributions
- **Development**: Continuous learning and growth opportunities for team members
- **Engagement**: Active participation and commitment in organizational activities

**Service Philosophy:**
- **Experience**: What we create for clients (not just "service")
- **Commitment**: Our promise and dedication to excellence
- **Innovation**: Creative approaches to improving operations and client experience
- **Accountability**: Individual and collective responsibility for outcomes

## Aviation-Specific Adaptations
When combining organizational vocabulary with aviation terminology:
- **Client Aircraft**: The aircraft belonging to or operated by our clients
- **Team Member Responsibilities**: Duties assigned to specific aviation roles
- **Safety Excellence**: Our unwavering commitment to the highest safety standards
- **Operational Solutions**: Aviation-specific procedures that address operational opportunities

## Hyperbole and Language Temperature

**Language Philosophy**: Use clear, direct language that communicates effectively without exaggeration or unnecessary complexity. Maintain a medium reading comprehension level to ensure accessibility for all team members and clients.

**Words to Avoid Entirely:**
- comprehensive, complete, detailed
- extreme, significant, important
- outstanding, exceptional, amazing
- cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, advanced
- world-class, premier, superior

**Preferred Language Patterns:**
- Use active voice: "Complete the inspection" not "The inspection should be completed"
- Choose specific terms: "Check fuel levels" not "Ensure fuel adequacy"
- Avoid intensifiers: Remove words like "very," "extremely," "incredibly"
- Use simple sentence structure: One main idea per sentence
- Select common words: "Help" instead of "facilitate," "use" instead of "utilize"

**Reading Level Guidelines:**
- Target 8th-10th grade reading level
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible
- Use familiar aviation terms but define technical acronyms
- Break complex procedures into simple steps
- Choose clarity over formality
