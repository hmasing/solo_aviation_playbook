# General Markdown Formatting Rules

## Core Formatting Standards

### Heading Hierarchy
- **H1 (`#`)**: Main document titles or section titles (avoid redundant words like "Process")
- **H2 (`##`)**: Major sections or individual topics
- **H3 (`###`)**: Subsections or major steps
- **H4 (`####`)**: Detailed sub-steps or components
- **H5 (`#####`)**: Specific actions or notes
- **H6 (`######`)**: References or additional details

### Alert and Notice Formatting
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Use for critical information that could result in serious consequences
- **⚡ CAUTION**: Use for operational cautions that could result in problems
- **ℹ️ NOTE**: Use for important information or reminders
- **✅ BEST PRACTICE**: Use for recommended approaches

### Checklists and Procedures
- Use numbered lists for sequential procedures: `1. Step one`
- Use bullet points for non-sequential items: `- Item`
- Use checkboxes for verification items: `- [ ] Item to verify`
- Use sub-bullets with consistent indentation: `  - Sub-item`

### Cross-References
- Link to other sections: `[Section Name](../section/file.md)`
- Link to assets: `[Asset Name](../../assets/category/file-name.pdf)`
- Link to external resources: `[External Resource](https://example.com/...)`

### Terminology Standards
- Use consistent terminology throughout documents
- Define acronyms on first use: `Example Organization (EO)`
- Use proper capitalization and formatting for names and titles

### Code Blocks and Examples
- Use code blocks for structured data, examples, or formatted text:
```
EXAMPLE FORMAT:
"Sample text or structured data example"
```

### Revision History Tables
- Always format revision history tables using code blocks for fixed-width font alignment
- Use consistent column widths with proper spacing for readability
- Include header separators using dashes to clearly define columns

### File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case: `example-document-name.md`
- Include logical prefixes when organizing: `01-section/01-document-name.md`
- Keep names descriptive but concise

### Version Control
- Include revision date in frontmatter
- Track major changes in document history
- Use semantic versioning for major updates

### Basic Document Template

```markdown
---
title: "Document Title"
section: "Category"
revision_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "1.0"
author: "Author Name"
---

# Document Title

Brief description of the document purpose.

## Overview

Explain what this document covers.

## Main Content

Organize content in logical sections with appropriate headings.

### Subsection

Use subsections to break down complex topics.

## References

- [Related Document](../path/to/document.md)
- [External Resource](https://example.com)

## Revision History

```text
| Date       | Version | Changes           | Author |
|------------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | 1.0     | Initial creation  | Name   |
```

## Document Templates

### Standard Document Structure
For consistent document formatting across projects:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Include title, section, dates, author, reviewer
2. **Document Title**: Clear, descriptive title
3. **Purpose/Overview**: Brief explanation of document purpose
4. **Main Content**: Organized in logical sections
5. **References**: Links to related documents or external resources
6. **Revision History**: Track changes and updates

### Frontmatter Template
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
section: "Category"
revision_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "1.0"
author: "Author Name"
reviewed_by: "Reviewer Name"
---
```

## Quality Standards
- All documents should be reviewed by appropriate personnel
- Include relevant references and citations
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout documents
- Ensure all cross-references and links are functional
- Regular review and updates as content evolves
- Use clear, concise language appropriate for the audience
- Follow established formatting conventions consistently
