# Work Order Creation and Scheduling

Manage work order creation and scheduling to ensure efficient maintenance operations and optimal resource utilization.

## Purpose

Establish a systematic approach to creating, documenting, and scheduling maintenance work orders that ensures efficient resource allocation, regulatory compliance, and clear communication between clients and maintenance team members throughout the maintenance process.

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Client Service Representative:**

- Manage client communications and service requests
- Process documentation and billing
- Obtain client authorizations and approvals
- Coordinate scheduling and aircraft availability
- Maintain professional client relationships

**Chief of Maintenance:**

- Review and approve complex or high-value work orders
- Assign qualified technicians to specific maintenance tasks
- Ensure regulatory compliance for all maintenance work
- Resolve scheduling conflicts and resource allocation issues
- Oversee maintenance quality and safety standards
## Process Steps

### Initial Work Order Creation

- **Collect client maintenance request** - Gather aircraft information, maintenance requirements, preferred dates, and any special client needs or constraints
- **Verify aircraft information** - Confirm aircraft registration, make, model, serial numbers, and current maintenance status in aircraft records
- **Review maintenance history** - Examine previous work orders, recurring maintenance items, and any outstanding airworthiness directives or service bulletins
- **Determine work scope** - Define specific maintenance tasks, regulatory requirements, and estimated labor hours based on manufacturer specifications

### Technical Assessment and Planning

- **Conduct preliminary inspection** - Perform visual assessment of aircraft condition to identify additional maintenance needs and verify reported discrepancies
- **Research regulatory requirements** - Review applicable FAA regulations, airworthiness directives, and manufacturer service bulletins for compliance obligations
- **Estimate parts and materials** - Identify required components, consumables, and special tools needed for maintenance completion
- **Calculate labor requirements** - Determine technician skill levels needed, estimated work hours, and potential overtime considerations

### Work Order Documentation

- **Create work order record** - Enter complete aircraft and client information into maintenance tracking system with unique work order number
- **Document work scope details** - Record specific maintenance tasks, regulatory references, and completion criteria in work order system
- **Attach supporting documentation** - Include manufacturer maintenance manuals, service bulletins, and previous maintenance records as references
- **Generate cost estimate** - Calculate total labor, parts, and miscellaneous costs with appropriate markup and present to client for approval

### Schedule Coordination

- **Check technician availability** - Review maintenance team member schedules and match qualified technicians to specific work requirements
- **Coordinate hangar space** - Reserve appropriate maintenance facility space based on aircraft size and work scope requirements
- **Schedule parts delivery** - Coordinate parts ordering and delivery timing to align with planned maintenance start dates
- **Confirm client schedule** - Verify aircraft availability dates and coordinate with client operational requirements

### Work Order Approval and Finalization

- **Obtain client authorization** - Present final work scope, cost estimate, and schedule to client for written approval before work commencement
- **Assign work order number** - Generate unique tracking number and enter into maintenance management system for progress monitoring
- **Distribute work assignments** - Provide detailed work order information to assigned technicians with clear task specifications and completion requirements
- **Update scheduling system** - Enter confirmed work order into master maintenance schedule with resource allocations and milestone dates

## Process Mapping

Flowchart to show sequential steps

## Tools and Resources

- Maintenance tracking software system
- Aircraft maintenance records and logbooks
- FAA regulations database (14 CFR Parts 43, 91)
- Manufacturer maintenance manuals and service bulletins
- Parts catalog and inventory management system
- Scheduling calendar and resource planning tools
- Cost estimation worksheets and pricing guidelines
- Client communication templates and authorization forms

## Success Metrics

- **Completion Time:** Work order creation process completed within 4 hours of client request.
- **Quality Standard:** 100% accuracy in aircraft information and regulatory compliance documentation.
- **Safety Standard:** Zero work orders processed without proper regulatory review and technician qualification verification.
- **Client Satisfaction:** 95% client approval rating for work order accuracy and schedule communication.


## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Issue:** Incomplete aircraft maintenance records affecting work scope determination
- **Solution:** Contact previous maintenance providers, review FAA records, and conduct thorough pre-maintenance inspection to establish baseline






**Issue:** Parts availability delays impacting scheduled maintenance completion
**Solution:** Maintain preferred vendor relationships, establish minimum stock levels for common components, and communicate delivery delays immediately to clients

**Issue:** Technician availability conflicts during peak maintenance periods
**Solution:** Cross-train team members on multiple aircraft types, maintain relationships with qualified contract technicians, and implement flexible scheduling procedures

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING:** Never authorize maintenance work without verifying technician qualifications and regulatory compliance requirements



⚡ **CAUTION:** Ensure all work orders include proper regulatory references and airworthiness requirements before technician assignment

ℹ️ **NOTE:** All work order modifications must be documented and approved by both client and maintenance leadership before implementation

✅ **BEST PRACTICE:** Review aircraft maintenance history and recurring issues before finalizing work scope to identify potential additional maintenance needs
