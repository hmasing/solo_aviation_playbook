**Quality Standard:** 98% schedule adherence with minimal last-minute changes or coverage gaps.

**Safety Standard:** Minimum staffing maintained for all safety-critical operations without exception.

**Client Satisfaction:** Adequate staffing supports 95% client satisfaction with service availability and response times.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Difficulty finding coverage for unexpected absences affecting service delivery
**Solution:** Maintain on-call list of qualified team members and cross-train personnel for multiple roles. Establish clear call-out procedures and response expectations.

**Issue:** Overtime costs exceeding budget due to scheduling inefficiencies
**Solution:** Analyze overtime patterns and adjust base schedules to reduce regular overtime needs. Implement scheduling software to optimize shift assignments and minimize gaps.

**Issue:** Timekeeping errors causing payroll inaccuracies and team member concerns
**Solution:** Implement digital timekeeping systems with supervisor approval workflows. Provide training on proper time recording and establish error correction procedures.

## Safety Considerations
