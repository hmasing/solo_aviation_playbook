**Completion Time:** Audit documentation prepared and organized within 5 business days of audit notification.

**Quality Standard:** 100% of requested documentation provided to auditors without delays or missing records.

**Safety Standard:** Audit processes don't disrupt safety-critical operations or compromise regulatory compliance.

**Client Satisfaction:** Audit activities conducted with minimal impact on client service delivery.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Missing or incomplete documentation discovered during audit preparation
**Solution:** Implement regular internal audit procedures to identify documentation gaps before external audits. Establish backup documentation procedures and maintain duplicate records for critical items.

**Issue:** Auditor requests exceeding scope or requiring excessive resources
**Solution:** Clarify audit scope and objectives with audit leader. Coordinate with legal counsel if requests appear unreasonable or outside audit authority.

**Issue:** Audit findings requiring significant operational changes
**Solution:** Develop phased implementation plans for major changes and coordinate with operations to minimize service disruption. Prioritize safety-critical findings for immediate implementation.

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING:** Ensure audit activities don't compromise safety operations or create security vulnerabilities



⚡ **CAUTION:** Coordinate auditor facility access with airport security requirements and operational schedules

ℹ️ **NOTE:** Maintain confidentiality of client information during audit activities and limit auditor access to necessary records only

✅ **BEST PRACTICE:** Use audit activities as opportunities to improve procedures and demonstrate operational excellence
