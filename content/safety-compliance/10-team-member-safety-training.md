## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** 100% of required initial training completed within 30 days of hire or job assignment.
**Quality Standard:** 95% of team members achieve passing scores on safety training assessments.
**Safety Standard:** Measurable improvement in safety performance following training implementation.
**Client Satisfaction:** Well-trained team members provide professional and safe service delivery.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Team members unable to attend scheduled training due to operational demands
**Solution:** Offer multiple training sessions; develop online training options; provide make-up training opportunities

**Issue:** Training content not relevant to actual job duties and hazards
**Solution:** Conduct job hazard analysis; involve frontline workers in training development; update content based on operational changes

**Issue:** Poor retention of safety training information over time
**Solution:** Implement frequent refresher training; use interactive training methods; provide job aids and reference materials

## Safety Considerations

- ⚠️ **WARNING**: Team members must not perform safety-critical tasks without completing required training and demonstrating competency



⚠️ **WARNING**: Ensure training covers all significant hazards and emergency procedures relevant to each position

⚡ **CAUTION**: Verify that training instructors are qualified and current on regulatory requirements and best practices

⚡ **CAUTION**: Keep training records current and accessible for regulatory inspections and incident investigations

ℹ️ **NOTE**: Training effectiveness should be measured by behavior change and safety performance improvement, not just completion rates

✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Involve experienced team members as mentors and subject matter experts in training programs
