# Ground Handling Safety Protocols

Establish ground handling safety protocols to protect personnel and aircraft during ramp operations.

---

## Purpose

Establish safety protocols for ground handling operations to protect personnel and aircraft during ramp activities including marshalling, towing, parking, and ground support equipment operation while ensuring compliance with FAA and OSHA safety standards.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Line Service Technician:**

- Provide direct aircraft handling services
- Execute safety protocols during aircraft movements
- Document all services provided accurately
- Coordinate with ground support equipment
- Monitor safety compliance during operations

**Safety Officer:**

- Monitor safety compliance across all operations
- Conduct safety investigations and reporting
- Coordinate safety training and certification
- Ensure regulatory safety compliance
- Authorize safety equipment and improvements

**Operations Leader:**

- Oversee daily operations and coordinate between departments
- Authorize emergency response procedures and resource allocation
- Monitor safety compliance and operational excellence
- Coordinate scheduling across departments for operational coverage
- Review billing disputes and approve service adjustments
- Ensure regulatory compliance across all operations
## Process Steps

### Pre-Operation Safety Phase

- **Conduct safety briefing** - Review daily safety considerations, weather conditions, and special handling requirements
- **Inspect work area** - Check ramp area for debris, obstacles, fuel spills, or other hazards
- **Verify equipment condition** - Inspect ground support equipment for proper operation and safety features
- **Review aircraft information** - Confirm aircraft type, weight, special handling requirements, and operational status
- **Establish communication** - Ensure radio communication with pilots, tower, and ground control as required
- **Check personal protective equipment** - Verify all team members have required PPE including hearing protection and high-visibility vests

### Aircraft Approach and Positioning Phase

- **Position marshalling equipment** - Place marshalling wands, cones, and safety equipment in designated positions
- **Establish visual contact** - Make eye contact with pilot and confirm marshalling signals are understood
- **Guide aircraft to parking** - Use standard marshalling signals to direct aircraft to designated parking position
- **Monitor clearances** - Ensure adequate clearance from other aircraft, equipment, and obstacles
- **Signal engine shutdown** - Use appropriate signals to indicate when aircraft should shut down engines
- **Verify parking brake** - Confirm pilot has set parking brake before approaching aircraft

### Ground Support Equipment Operation Phase

- **Conduct pre-operation inspection** - Check hydraulic fluid levels, tire condition, and safety systems on tugs and equipment
- **Connect equipment safely** - Attach tow bars, ground power units, and other equipment using proper procedures
- **Test equipment operation** - Verify proper operation of hydraulic systems, brakes, and safety features
- **Maintain safe speeds** - Operate ground support equipment at appropriate speeds for conditions and aircraft type
- **Monitor aircraft stress** - Watch for signs of aircraft structural stress during towing or pushback operations
- **Use spotters** - Deploy spotters to monitor clearances and provide guidance during equipment operation

### Personnel Safety Phase

- **Maintain situational awareness** - Stay alert to aircraft engines, propellers, and other moving equipment
- **Follow approach procedures** - Never approach aircraft from front or rear; use designated safe approach zones
- **Wear required PPE** - Use hearing protection, high-visibility clothing, and safety equipment as required
- **Communicate clearly** - Use hand signals, radios, or intercom systems to maintain clear communication
- **Avoid hazardous areas** - Stay clear of jet blast areas, propeller arcs, and other dangerous zones
- **Report unsafe conditions** - Immediately report any unsafe conditions or equipment malfunctions

### Aircraft Securing Phase

- **Install wheel chocks** - Place wheel chocks properly to prevent aircraft movement
- **Connect ground power** - Attach ground power units if requested by pilot or maintenance personnel
- **Secure loose items** - Ensure all ground support equipment and materials are properly secured
- **Complete inspection** - Check aircraft and surrounding area for damage, leaks, or safety hazards
- **Document services** - Record ground handling services provided and any observations or issues
- **Coordinate next services** - Communicate with fueling, maintenance, or other service teams as needed

### Equipment Shutdown and Storage Phase

- **Shut down equipment properly** - Follow manufacturer procedures for shutting down ground support equipment
- **Inspect for damage** - Check equipment for damage, leaks, or wear that requires maintenance attention
- **Clean equipment** - Remove debris and contamination from equipment surfaces and components
- **Return to storage** - Park equipment in designated storage areas with proper security measures
- **Complete maintenance logs** - Document equipment operation hours and any maintenance requirements
- **Report deficiencies** - Notify maintenance personnel of any equipment issues requiring attention

## Tools and Resources

**Ground Support Equipment:**

- Aircraft tugs and tow bars
- Ground power units and air start units
- Wheel chocks and tie-down equipment
- Marshalling wands and safety cones

**Safety Equipment:**

- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Two-way radios and communication systems
- Fire extinguishers and spill response materials
- First aid kits and emergency contact information

**Documentation:**

- Ground handling service records
- Equipment inspection checklists
- Safety incident reporting forms
- Aircraft damage inspection forms

---

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Standard ground handling operations completed within established time parameters for aircraft type.
**Quality Standard:** Zero aircraft damage incidents and 100% compliance with ground handling safety procedures.
**Safety Standard:** Zero personnel injuries and equipment accidents during ground handling operations.
**Client Satisfaction:** Professional ground handling service that meets or exceeds client expectations for safety and efficiency.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Communication breakdown between ground crew and flight crew
**Solution:** Establish clear communication protocols, use standard hand signals, and ensure backup communication methods are available

**Issue:** Ground support equipment malfunction during operations
**Solution:** Conduct thorough pre-operation inspections, maintain backup equipment availability, and implement immediate equipment shutdown procedures

**Issue:** Personnel entering hazardous areas around aircraft
**Solution:** Provide enhanced safety training, use physical barriers when possible, and implement buddy system for high-risk operations

---

## Safety Considerations

- ⚠️ **WARNING**: Never approach aircraft with engines running; maintain minimum 50-foot clearance from propeller arcs



⚠️ **WARNING**: Always use proper lifting techniques when handling heavy equipment; never exceed personal lifting capabilities

⚡ **CAUTION**: Check aircraft weight and balance limitations before towing or moving aircraft

⚡ **CAUTION**: Ensure adequate clearance between aircraft and obstacles during all ground handling operations

ℹ️ **NOTE**: Weather conditions significantly affect ground handling safety; adjust procedures for wind, precipitation, and visibility

✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct regular safety meetings to review procedures and discuss lessons learned from incidents
