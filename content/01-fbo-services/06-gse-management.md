# Ground Support Equipment Management Process

Manage ground support equipment inventory, maintenance, and deployment to ensure reliable equipment availability and safe operation for all aircraft service requirements.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Purpose

This process establishes procedures for ground support equipment management to ensure equipment reliability, operator safety, and efficient service delivery while maintaining regulatory compliance and optimizing equipment utilization across all FBO operations.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Equipment Manager:**
Oversee equipment inventory management and coordinate maintenance schedules while ensuring regulatory compliance
Monitor equipment utilization and coordinate procurement of new equipment based on operational requirements and usage analysis

**Ground Equipment Technician:**
Conduct daily equipment inspections and perform routine maintenance procedures according to manufacturer specifications
Operate equipment safely and document any operational issues or maintenance requirements for management review

**Operations Supervisor:**
Coordinate equipment deployment and scheduling while ensuring adequate equipment availability during peak operational periods
Monitor equipment operator certification status and coordinate training programs for new team members

**Safety Coordinator:**
Conduct equipment safety inspections and ensure compliance with safety regulations and operational procedures
Investigate equipment-related incidents and coordinate corrective actions to prevent future safety issues

## Process Steps

### Daily Operations Phase
- [ ] **Conduct equipment inspection** - Perform comprehensive visual, operational, and safety system checks on all ground support equipment
- [ ] **Document equipment status** - Record condition and availability in equipment management system with detailed inspection notes
- [ ] **Review maintenance schedules** - Check scheduled maintenance requirements and coordinate with team for upcoming service intervals
- [ ] **Verify operator certifications** - Confirm equipment operator certification status and coordinate additional training if required

### Equipment Deployment Phase
- [ ] **Assign equipment to operations** - Match equipment to specific operations based on aircraft requirements and operational priorities
- [ ] **Conduct pre-operation safety check** - Verify fluid levels, safety systems, and operational controls before deployment
- [ ] **Deploy equipment to service locations** - Position equipment at designated locations and coordinate with line service team
- [ ] **Monitor operational performance** - Track equipment performance during operations and coordinate with operators for any issues

### Post-Operation Phase
- [ ] **Conduct post-operation inspection** - Examine equipment after use and document any maintenance requirements or observations
- [ ] **Return equipment to storage** - Secure equipment in designated storage areas with proper environmental protection
- [ ] **Coordinate maintenance activities** - Schedule and coordinate maintenance with qualified technicians and maintain records
- [ ] **Manage parts and supplies** - Monitor parts inventory and coordinate with suppliers for maintenance supplies and components

### Analysis and Planning Phase
- [ ] **Analyze equipment utilization** - Review usage patterns and identify opportunities for improved utilization and efficiency
- [ ] **Coordinate training programs** - Manage operator training programs and maintain current certification records for all operators
- [ ] **Plan equipment replacement** - Monitor equipment condition and coordinate replacement planning based on usage and costs
- [ ] **Update operational procedures** - Review and update equipment procedures based on operational experience and feedback

## Process Mapping

Flowchart showing equipment inspection, deployment, operational monitoring, and maintenance coordination with decision points for safety compliance and utilization optimization.

## Tools and Resources

- Ground support equipment inventory including tugs, ground power units, and service vehicles
- Equipment maintenance tracking system and inspection documentation forms
- Operator training materials and certification tracking systems
- Parts inventory management system and supplier contact information
- Safety inspection equipment and regulatory compliance documentation
- Equipment utilization tracking and analysis software

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Equipment deployment completed within 5 minutes of service request.
**Quality Standard:** 98% equipment availability during operational hours with minimal downtime.
**Safety Standard:** Zero equipment-related safety incidents and 100% compliance with inspection requirements.
**Client Satisfaction:** 94% client satisfaction with equipment reliability and service delivery.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Equipment breakdown during critical service operations
**Solution:** Implement backup equipment protocols, coordinate immediate maintenance response, and deploy alternative equipment to maintain service continuity

**Issue:** Operator certification lapses affecting equipment availability
**Solution:** Maintain current training schedules, implement certification tracking alerts, and cross-train operators on multiple equipment types

**Issue:** Parts availability delays affecting maintenance schedules
**Solution:** Maintain critical parts inventory, establish relationships with multiple suppliers, and implement predictive maintenance to anticipate parts needs

## Safety Considerations
⚠️ **WARNING**: Verify equipment operator certification and conduct pre-operation safety briefing before equipment deployment
⚠️ **WARNING**: Never operate equipment with known safety system malfunctions or incomplete maintenance requirements
⚡ **CAUTION**: Maintain proper clearances when operating equipment near aircraft and ensure all personnel are clear of equipment operation areas
ℹ️ **NOTE**: Monitor weather conditions and suspend equipment operations during unsafe environmental conditions
✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct monthly equipment safety meetings and maintain current manufacturer service bulletins and updates

## Regulatory References
- OSHA 29 CFR 1910 - General Industry Standards for Equipment Operation
- 14 CFR Part 139 - Airport Operating Requirements for Ground Equipment
- Manufacturer equipment operation and maintenance manuals
- Company equipment safety and maintenance procedures
- Equipment operator training and certification standards
