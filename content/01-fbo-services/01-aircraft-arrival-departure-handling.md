# Aircraft Arrival and Departure Handling Process

Provide comprehensive handling services for arriving and departing aircraft to ensure safe, efficient, and professional client experience.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Purpose

This process establishes procedures for managing aircraft arrivals and departures to ensure safe ground operations, exceptional client experience, and efficient ramp utilization while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational excellence.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Line Service Technician:**
Provide direct aircraft handling services including marshalling, parking guidance, and initial client contact
Execute safety protocols and coordinate with ground support equipment operators during aircraft movements

**Operations Supervisor:**
Oversee ramp operations and coordinate between multiple aircraft movements and service requests
Monitor safety compliance and resolve operational challenges during peak activity periods

**Client Service Representative:**
Manage client communications and coordinate service requests from arrival through departure
Process documentation and billing while maintaining professional client relationships throughout the experience

**Ramp Safety Coordinator:**
Ensure all ground operations comply with safety regulations and monitor hazardous conditions
Conduct safety briefings and maintain situational awareness during complex aircraft movements

## Process Steps

### Pre-Arrival Phase

- [ ] **Review flight plan information** - Confirm aircraft type, arrival time, and special requirements
- [ ] **Verify ramp space availability** - Check assigned parking position and clearance requirements
- [ ] **Prepare ground support equipment** - Position required equipment and verify operational status
- [ ] **Monitor aircraft approach** - Track inbound aircraft progress via radio communications and ATC coordination

### Aircraft Arrival Phase

- [ ] **Set up marshalling position** - Position equipment and personnel with proper safety gear and communication devices
- [ ] **Guide aircraft to parking** - Provide visual marshalling signals using standard hand signals for precise positioning
- [ ] **Conduct initial safety assessment** - Verify aircraft position, chock placement, and equipment positioning
- [ ] **Greet clients professionally** - Welcome clients and assess immediate service needs (fuel, ground power, passenger services)

### Service Coordination Phase

- [ ] **Document service requests** - Record all requested services and coordinate timing with team members and vendors
- [ ] **Monitor service progress** - Maintain client communication regarding timing and operational updates
- [ ] **Coordinate ongoing services** - Ensure efficient delivery of fuel, maintenance, catering, and other requested services

### Pre-Departure Phase

- [ ] **Confirm service completion** - Verify all services are completed and documented for billing
- [ ] **Coordinate departure timing** - Communicate with clients regarding departure requirements and timing
- [ ] **Prepare for engine start** - Remove ground support equipment and conduct final safety inspection
- [ ] **Provide fire guard services** - Monitor engine start for safety concerns and irregularities

### Departure Phase

- [ ] **Guide aircraft to taxiway** - Provide marshalling signals for safe taxi using appropriate safety protocols
- [ ] **Complete final documentation** - Update service records, billing information, and operational notes
- [ ] **Reset ramp area** - Clear and inspect parking area, return equipment to storage, prepare for next aircraft
- [ ] **Conduct service follow-up** - Contact clients post-departure for feedback and coordinate future services

## Process Mapping

Flowchart showing sequential steps from aircraft approach monitoring through post-departure follow-up with decision points for service coordination and safety assessments.

## Tools and Resources

- Aircraft marshalling wands and safety equipment
- Ground support equipment (chocks, cones, fire extinguisher)
- Radio communication equipment and frequency references
- Service request forms and billing documentation systems
- Weather monitoring equipment and runway condition reports
- Emergency contact lists and safety protocol references

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Aircraft handling process completed within 15 minutes of arrival.
**Quality Standard:** Zero safety incidents and 100% client satisfaction with arrival/departure experience.
**Safety Standard:** All ground operations completed without FOD incidents or equipment damage.
**Client Satisfaction:** 95% or higher client satisfaction rating for arrival and departure services.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Aircraft arrives during peak ramp traffic with limited parking space
**Solution:** Coordinate with operations supervisor for alternative parking assignments and communicate revised timing to client

**Issue:** Ground support equipment malfunction during critical service period
**Solution:** Implement backup equipment protocols and coordinate with maintenance team for immediate repair or replacement

**Issue:** Weather conditions affect safe marshalling operations
**Solution:** Activate adverse weather procedures, use alternative communication methods, and coordinate with air traffic control for timing adjustments

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Maintain minimum 25-foot clearance from operating aircraft engines and propellers at all times
⚡ **CAUTION**: Verify aircraft parking brake engagement and proper chock placement before approaching aircraft
ℹ️ **NOTE**: Monitor weather conditions and wind direction during all marshalling operations
✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct pre-shift briefing on current NOTAMs, runway conditions, and operational priorities
