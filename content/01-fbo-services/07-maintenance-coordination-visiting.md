# Maintenance Coordination for Visiting Aircraft

Coordinate maintenance services for visiting aircraft by managing vendor relationships and ensuring quality service delivery while maintaining client communication and regulatory compliance.

## Purpose

This process establishes procedures for coordinating maintenance services for visiting general aviation aircraft to ensure timely, quality repairs and inspections while managing vendor relationships, maintaining regulatory compliance, and providing clear client communication throughout the maintenance process. Our facility coordinates maintenance for typical Part 91 aircraft including single-engine trainers from our Part 61 flight school (Cessna 172, Piper Cherokee) and transient turboprop aircraft (King Air, Pilatus, TBM series).

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Maintenance Coordinator:**
Coordinate maintenance service requests with qualified vendors and monitor service delivery quality and timing
Maintain vendor relationships and ensure all maintenance providers meet regulatory requirements and quality standards

**Client Service Representative:**
Communicate maintenance requirements with clients and provide regular updates on service progress and timing
Process maintenance service requests and coordinate billing arrangements with clients and maintenance providers

**Quality Assurance Inspector:**
Review maintenance work quality and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements before aircraft return to service
Coordinate with maintenance providers for any corrective actions and maintain documentation for regulatory compliance

**Operations Leader:**
Oversee maintenance operations coordination and ensure minimal disruption to other FBO operations during maintenance activities
Coordinate hangar space allocation and equipment requirements for maintenance activities

## Process Steps

### Request Assessment Phase

- **Evaluate maintenance request** - Assess client request and determine appropriate maintenance provider based on aircraft type and requirements
- **Select qualified vendor** - Choose maintenance provider and coordinate service scheduling based on availability and client timing
- **Communicate with client** - Present maintenance proposal including cost estimates, timing, and service provider information for approval
- **Process work order** - Create work order with service requirements and coordinate with provider for service initiation

### Service Coordination Phase

- **Coordinate facility requirements** - Arrange hangar space allocation and specialized equipment with facility management and provider
- **Initiate maintenance service** - Start maintenance service with client notification and establish communication protocols for updates
- **Monitor service progress** - Track maintenance progress and provide regular client updates regarding status and any timing changes
- **Coordinate quality control** - Arrange quality control inspection of completed work and verify regulatory compliance

### Completion Phase

- **Review documentation** - Examine maintenance documentation including logbook entries, compliance records, and warranty information
- **Notify client of completion** - Inform client of maintenance completion and coordinate aircraft return to service with inspection results
- **Coordinate billing** - Manage billing between maintenance provider and client while ensuring accurate documentation and cost verification
- **Conduct follow-up assessment** - Evaluate client satisfaction with maintenance service quality and address concerns or warranty issues

### Quality Assurance Phase

- **Evaluate vendor performance** - Assess maintenance provider performance and document service quality for future selection
- **Ensure regulatory compliance** - Verify all maintenance documentation meets regulatory requirements and maintain audit records
- **Analyze process efficiency** - Review maintenance coordination process and identify opportunities for improved service and vendor management
- **Update procedures** - Incorporate lessons learned and best practices into maintenance coordination procedures

- Maintenance work order processing system and documentation templates
- Client communication tools and progress tracking systems
- Quality assurance inspection checklists and regulatory compliance references
- Billing coordination systems and vendor payment processing tools
- Maintenance service evaluation forms and vendor performance tracking systems

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Maintenance coordination initiated within 2 hours of client request.
**Quality Standard:** 100% regulatory compliance for all coordinated maintenance services.
**Safety Standard:** Zero maintenance-related safety incidents and complete documentation accuracy.
**Client Satisfaction:** 93% client satisfaction with maintenance coordination and communication quality.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Preferred maintenance provider unavailable during client required timeframe
**Solution:** Maintain relationships with multiple qualified providers and coordinate alternative service arrangements with comparable quality standards

**Issue:** Maintenance scope increases beyond original estimate during service
**Solution:** Implement immediate client communication protocols and coordinate approval procedures for additional work authorization

**Issue:** Maintenance documentation discrepancies affecting aircraft return to service
**Solution:** Coordinate immediate documentation review with maintenance provider and regulatory authorities to resolve compliance issues

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Verify maintenance provider certifications and regulatory compliance before authorizing any maintenance work
⚡ **CAUTION**: Ensure all maintenance work is properly documented and meets regulatory requirements before aircraft return to service
ℹ️ **NOTE**: Maintain current knowledge of regulatory requirements and coordinate with appropriate authorities when required
✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct regular vendor performance reviews and maintain relationships with multiple qualified maintenance providers
