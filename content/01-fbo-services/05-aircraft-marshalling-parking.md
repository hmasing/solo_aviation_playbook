# Aircraft Marshalling and Parking

Provide safe and efficient aircraft ground guidance and parking services to ensure proper aircraft positioning while maintaining ramp safety and operational efficiency.

## Purpose

This process establishes procedures for general aviation aircraft marshalling and parking operations to ensure safe aircraft ground movement, optimal ramp space utilization, and compliance with ground safety regulations while providing professional guidance services to pilots and aircraft operators. Our operations focus on Part 91 general aviation aircraft including single-engine aircraft (Cessna 172, Piper Cherokee), light twins, and turboprop aircraft (King Air, Pilatus, TBM series).

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Aircraft Marshaller:**
Provide visual guidance signals to pilots during aircraft taxi and parking operations using standard hand signals
Maintain situational awareness of ramp traffic and coordinate with ground control for safe aircraft movement

**Ramp Safety Officer:**
Monitor all ground operations for safety compliance and coordinate emergency response if required
Conduct safety briefings and ensure all personnel follow established safety protocols during aircraft movements

**Ground Operations Coordinator:**
Coordinate aircraft parking assignments and optimize ramp space utilization during peak operational periods
Manage ground support equipment positioning and coordinate with multiple aircraft operations simultaneously

**Line Service Technician:**
Position safety equipment and assist with aircraft parking operations including chock placement and tie-down procedures
Monitor aircraft systems during ground operations and coordinate with pilots for any operational requirements

## Process Steps

### Pre-Marshalling Phase

- **Assess ramp conditions** - Verify parking space availability and confirm aircraft specifications for appropriate assignment
- **Position safety equipment** - Place marshalling equipment, safety cones, and fire extinguisher with clear escape routes
- **Establish communications** - Set up radio contact with pilot and ground control while positioning for optimal visual contact
- **Initiate aircraft contact** - Signal aircraft using standard marshalling wands and establish visual communication with pilot

### Aircraft Guidance Phase

- **Coordinate taxi guidance** - Provide clear directional signals for aircraft taxi path while monitoring for obstacles and traffic
- **Guide to parking position** - Direct aircraft using precise hand signals while maintaining safe distances from obstacles
- **Provide fine positioning signals** - Make final adjustments for optimal aircraft positioning within designated boundaries
- **Coordinate engine shutdown** - Signal pilot for shutdown when aircraft is properly positioned and safety requirements are met

### Aircraft Securing Phase

- **Install wheel chocks** - Place chocks immediately after engine shutdown using proper techniques and verify secure placement
- **Establish safety area** - Position safety cones and establish clear boundaries around parked aircraft for ground operations
- **Install tie-down equipment** - Secure aircraft tie-downs when required for weather protection or extended parking
- **Connect ground power** - Attach ground power unit if requested and verify proper electrical connection and operation

### Completion Phase

- **Conduct final safety inspection** - Review aircraft parking setup including chocks, tie-downs, and safety equipment positioning
- **Complete parking documentation** - Record aircraft location, time, and any special requirements or observations
- **Clear marshalling area** - Remove marshalling equipment and ensure area is safe for ongoing ramp operations
- **Coordinate handoff** - Transfer aircraft to appropriate service personnel and communicate any special requirements

## Tools and Resources

- Aircraft marshalling wands and reflective safety equipment
- Wheel chocks appropriate for various aircraft types and sizes
- Safety cones and ground marking equipment
- Radio communication equipment with appropriate frequencies
- Ground power units and electrical connection equipment
- Tie-down equipment and hardware for aircraft securing

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Aircraft marshalling and parking completed within 10 minutes of initial contact.
**Quality Standard:** 100% accuracy in aircraft positioning within designated parking boundaries.
**Safety Standard:** Zero incidents involving aircraft or ground personnel during marshalling operations.
**Client Satisfaction:** 96% pilot satisfaction with marshalling service quality and professionalism.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Poor visibility conditions affecting marshalling signal clarity
**Solution:** Use additional lighting equipment, coordinate with ground control for alternative guidance, and implement radio communication backup procedures

**Issue:** Aircraft size exceeds designated parking space dimensions
**Solution:** Coordinate alternative parking location assignment and adjust ground support equipment positioning for larger aircraft requirements

**Issue:** Multiple aircraft arrivals creating ramp congestion
**Solution:** Implement sequential parking coordination with ground control and optimize space utilization through dynamic parking assignments

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Maintain minimum 25-foot clearance from operating aircraft engines and never approach aircraft from engine intake areas
⚠️ **WARNING**: Ensure all personnel wear high-visibility safety equipment and maintain radio communication during aircraft movements
⚡ **CAUTION**: Verify aircraft parking brake engagement before approaching for chock placement or ground service connections
ℹ️ **NOTE**: Monitor wind conditions and adjust marshalling position to maintain clear visual contact with pilot
✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct daily briefing on current NOTAMs, runway conditions, and special aircraft handling requirements
