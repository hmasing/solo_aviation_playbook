## Roles and Responsibilities

**Parts Coordinator:**

- Manage daily parts inventory operations and stock level monitoring
- Process parts orders and coordinate delivery scheduling with vendors
- Verify parts authenticity and airworthiness documentation upon receipt
- Maintain accurate inventory records and cost tracking systems

**Chief of Maintenance:**

- Approve parts procurement policies and vendor selection criteria
- Review and authorize high-value parts purchases and emergency orders
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for parts quality and documentation
- Oversee inventory management procedures and cost control measures

**A&P Mechanic:**

- Submit parts requests with detailed specifications and installation requirements
- Verify parts compatibility and configuration before installation
- Report parts quality issues or discrepancies to Parts Coordinator
- Return unused parts to inventory with proper documentation

**Purchasing Leader:**

- Negotiate vendor contracts and pricing agreements for parts procurement
- Review and approve vendor qualifications and quality certifications
- Monitor parts procurement costs and budget compliance
- Coordinate with finance team for payment processing and vendor relations

## Process Steps

### Inventory Management and Control

- **Monitor stock levels** - Review daily inventory reports and identify parts approaching minimum stock levels or requiring reorder
- **Conduct periodic inventory audits** - Perform monthly physical counts of high-value items and quarterly complete inventory verification
- **Track parts usage patterns** - Analyze consumption data to optimize stock levels and identify seasonal or aircraft-specific requirements
- **Maintain inventory accuracy** - Update inventory records immediately upon parts receipt, issue, and return to ensure accurate stock information

### Parts Procurement and Ordering

- **Review parts requests** - Verify parts specifications, quantities, and installation requirements against maintenance work orders and technical documentation
- **Source approved suppliers** - Select vendors from approved supplier list based on parts availability, pricing, and delivery requirements
- **Prepare purchase orders** - Generate detailed purchase orders including part numbers, quantities, delivery requirements, and quality specifications
- **Track order status** - Monitor order progress and coordinate with vendors to ensure on-time delivery for scheduled maintenance activities

### Quality Control and Receiving

- **Inspect incoming parts** - Examine all received parts for damage, proper packaging, and compliance with order specifications
- **Verify airworthiness documentation** - Review certificates of conformity, airworthiness tags, and traceability documentation for regulatory compliance
- **Update inventory records** - Enter received parts into inventory system with location, cost, and documentation information
- **Process discrepancies** - Handle damaged, incorrect, or improperly documented parts through vendor return and replacement procedures

### Parts Storage and Preservation

- **Store parts properly** - Place parts in appropriate storage locations with proper environmental controls and protection from damage
- **Maintain shelf life tracking** - Monitor time-limited parts and consumables to ensure use before expiration dates
- **Implement security measures** - Secure high-value and controlled parts in locked storage with access control and tracking
- **Preserve parts condition** - Apply appropriate preservation methods for long-term storage and protect against corrosion and deterioration

### Issue and Documentation Control

- **Process parts requisitions** - Issue parts to technicians with proper documentation and work order authorization
- **Maintain traceability records** - Document parts installation history and maintain records for warranty and regulatory requirements
- **Handle returns and exchanges** - Process unused parts returns and coordinate warranty exchanges with suppliers
- **Update cost tracking** - Allocate parts costs to appropriate work orders and maintain accurate job costing information

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Parts orders processed within 2 hours of request; emergency orders within 30 minutes.
**Quality Standard:** 100% accuracy in parts specifications and airworthiness documentation verification.
**Safety Standard:** Zero installation of unapproved or improperly documented parts.
**Client Satisfaction:** 95% parts availability for scheduled maintenance without delays.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Parts availability delays from suppliers affecting maintenance schedules
**Solution:** Maintain multiple approved suppliers for common parts, establish minimum stock levels for critical components, and implement expedited ordering procedures

**Issue:** Parts quality or documentation discrepancies discovered upon receipt
**Solution:** Implement systematic receiving inspection procedures, maintain vendor quality ratings, and establish clear return and replacement protocols

**Issue:** Inventory accuracy problems affecting parts availability and cost control
**Solution:** Implement regular cycle counting procedures, use barcode scanning systems when possible, and establish clear parts issue and return procedures

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING:** Never install parts without proper airworthiness documentation and regulatory approval

⚡ **CAUTION:** Ensure proper storage conditions for all parts to prevent deterioration and maintain airworthiness

ℹ️ **NOTE:** All parts must be traceable from installation back to original manufacturer certification

✅ **BEST PRACTICE:** Maintain relationships with multiple approved suppliers to ensure parts availability and competitive pricing
