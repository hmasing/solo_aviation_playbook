# 100-Hour and Annual Inspection Execution

Execute regulatory inspections in compliance with FAA requirements to maintain aircraft airworthiness certification.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Purpose

Establish systematic procedures for conducting 100-hour and annual inspections in accordance with 14 CFR Part 91.409 requirements. These inspections ensure continued airworthiness, regulatory compliance, and safe aircraft operation while maintaining detailed documentation for certification purposes.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Inspector (IA for Annual Inspections):**

- Conduct or supervise all required inspection procedures
- Sign off completed inspections and return aircraft to service
- Ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements and airworthiness directives
- Review and approve all maintenance actions performed during inspection

**A&P Mechanic:**

- Perform detailed inspection procedures under Inspector supervision
- Execute required maintenance actions identified during inspection
- Document all findings and corrective actions in aircraft records
- Assist with disassembly and reassembly as required for inspection access

**Maintenance Scheduler:**

- Coordinate inspection scheduling with client operational requirements
- Ensure required parts and materials are available before inspection start
- Track inspection progress and communicate timeline updates to clients
- Schedule follow-up maintenance for items requiring future attention

**Client Service Representative:**

- Communicate inspection requirements and timeline to clients
- Obtain client authorization for additional maintenance discovered during inspection
- Provide regular progress updates throughout inspection process
- Coordinate aircraft delivery upon inspection completion

## Process Steps

### Pre-Inspection Planning

- **Verify inspection requirements** - Confirm 100-hour or annual inspection due date and review aircraft operating time since last inspection
- **Review maintenance records** - Examine logbooks for compliance with airworthiness directives, service bulletins, and previous inspection findings
- **Prepare inspection workspace** - Set up adequate lighting, tools, and documentation materials in appropriate hangar or maintenance area
- **Gather technical references** - Collect current manufacturer maintenance manuals, inspection checklists, and regulatory guidance materials

### Engine and Propeller Inspection

- **Remove engine cowling** - Carefully remove and inspect cowling components while checking for cracks, security, and proper fit
- **Inspect engine external components** - Examine engine mounts, accessories, hoses, and wiring for security, wear, leaks, or damage
- **Check propeller and spinner** - Inspect propeller blades, hub, and spinner for cracks, nicks, security, and proper track and balance
- **Examine engine controls** - Test throttle, mixture, propeller, and carburetor heat controls for proper operation and security

### Airframe Structural Inspection

- **Inspect fuselage structure** - Examine skin, frames, bulkheads, and attachment points for cracks, corrosion, or structural damage
- **Check wing and control surfaces** - Inspect wings, ailerons, elevator, rudder, and trim tabs for structural integrity and proper rigging
- **Examine landing gear system** - Inspect struts, wheels, brakes, tires, and retraction systems for wear, damage, or operational deficiencies
- **Review flight control systems** - Check control cables, pulleys, bellcranks, and connections for proper tension, wear, and security

### Systems and Equipment Inspection

- **Test avionics and electrical systems** - Verify operation of all navigation, communication, and electrical systems while checking for proper installation
- **Inspect cabin and cockpit** - Check seats, belts, controls, instruments, and placards for security, condition, and regulatory compliance
- **Examine fuel and oil systems** - Inspect tanks, lines, filters, and pumps for leaks, security, and proper operation
- **Review emergency equipment** - Verify presence, condition, and currency of required emergency and safety equipment

### Airworthiness Directive Compliance

- **Review applicable ADs** - Check current airworthiness directive status and compliance for aircraft, engine, and propeller
- **Perform required AD actions** - Execute any recurring airworthiness directive requirements due at inspection interval
- **Document AD compliance** - Record completion of all airworthiness directive actions in aircraft maintenance records
- **Update AD tracking system** - Enter next compliance dates for recurring airworthiness directives in tracking database

### Final Documentation and Certification

- **Complete inspection checklist** - Verify all required inspection items have been completed and documented according to regulatory requirements
- **Document discrepancies and actions** - Record all findings, corrective actions, and deferred maintenance items in aircraft logbooks
- **Prepare return to service entry** - Complete required logbook entries certifying inspection completion and aircraft airworthiness
- **Coordinate client delivery** - Schedule aircraft return with client and provide inspection summary and any recommended future maintenance

## Process Mapping

Flowchart to show sequential steps

## Tools and Resources

- 14 CFR Part 91 Appendix D inspection checklist
- Manufacturer maintenance manuals and service bulletins
- Current airworthiness directive database and tracking system
- Inspection tools, mirrors, and measurement equipment
- Aircraft maintenance logbooks and record forms
- Parts catalogs and technical service information
- Digital camera for discrepancy documentation
- Client communication and authorization forms

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** 100-hour inspection completed within 16 hours; annual inspection within 24 hours.
**Quality Standard:** 100% compliance with regulatory inspection requirements and airworthiness directive actions.
**Safety Standard:** Zero missed inspection items or airworthiness deficiencies at aircraft delivery.
**Client Satisfaction:** 95% client approval rating for inspection quality and communication throughout process.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Discovery of airworthiness directives not previously complied with during inspection
**Solution:** Maintain current AD database subscriptions, implement systematic AD tracking procedures, and budget time for unexpected compliance actions

**Issue:** Parts availability delays for discrepancies discovered during inspection
**Solution:** Maintain inventory of common inspection-related parts, establish expedited parts ordering procedures, and communicate delays immediately to clients

**Issue:** Inspection timeline extensions due to additional maintenance requirements
**Solution:** Conduct thorough pre-inspection assessment, maintain realistic time estimates, and establish clear client communication protocols for scope changes

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING:** Never return aircraft to service with unresolved airworthiness discrepancies or incomplete inspection requirements

⚡ **CAUTION:** Ensure proper documentation of all inspection findings and corrective actions before aircraft release

ℹ️ **NOTE:** All inspection work must be performed by appropriately certified personnel with current qualifications

✅ **BEST PRACTICE:** Use standardized inspection checklists and maintain current technical references for consistent inspection quality
