# Scheduled Maintenance

Perform scheduled maintenance on airframe, engine, and avionics systems according to manufacturer specifications and regulatory requirements.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Purpose

Execute scheduled maintenance tasks in accordance with manufacturer maintenance programs, regulatory requirements, and established intervals to ensure continued aircraft airworthiness, reliability, and optimal performance while maintaining detailed documentation for compliance purposes.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Chief of Maintenance:**

- Review and approve scheduled maintenance programs and intervals
- Assign qualified technicians to specific maintenance tasks
- Ensure compliance with manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements
- Oversee quality control and final inspection of completed maintenance

**A&P Mechanic:**

- Execute scheduled maintenance tasks according to manufacturer specifications
- Document all maintenance actions and findings in aircraft records
- Identify and report additional maintenance requirements discovered during scheduled work
- Perform operational tests and system checks following maintenance completion

**Parts Coordinator:**

- Ensure availability of required parts and materials before maintenance start
- Order and receive parts according to manufacturer specifications and quality standards
- Maintain inventory of consumable items for scheduled maintenance tasks
- Coordinate expedited parts delivery when schedule delays occur

**Client Service Representative:**

- Communicate scheduled maintenance requirements and timelines to clients
- Coordinate aircraft scheduling around mandatory maintenance intervals
- Provide progress updates throughout scheduled maintenance process
- Deliver completed aircraft and maintenance documentation to clients

## Process Steps

### Maintenance Planning and Preparation

- [ ] **Review maintenance program requirements** - Examine manufacturer maintenance manual for specific tasks, intervals, and compliance requirements due at current aircraft hours or calendar time
- [ ] **Verify parts and materials availability** - Confirm all required components, consumables, and special tools are available before maintenance commencement
- [ ] **Prepare maintenance workspace** - Set up appropriate hangar space, lighting, tools, and safety equipment for efficient maintenance execution
- [ ] **Review aircraft maintenance history** - Examine previous maintenance records for recurring issues, modifications, or special considerations affecting current maintenance

### Engine and Powerplant Maintenance

- [ ] **Perform engine oil and filter change** - Drain engine oil, replace filter, and refill with manufacturer-specified oil type and quantity according to maintenance manual procedures
- [ ] **Inspect engine accessories and components** - Examine magnetos, carburetor, fuel pumps, and electrical components for wear, security, and proper operation
- [ ] **Check engine controls and linkages** - Verify proper operation and rigging of throttle, mixture, propeller, and carburetor heat controls within manufacturer specifications
- [ ] **Test engine operational parameters** - Verify engine performance, temperatures, pressures, and RPM ranges meet manufacturer specifications during ground run

### Airframe and Systems Maintenance

- [ ] **Lubricate airframe components** - Apply appropriate lubricants to landing gear, control surfaces, hinges, and bearings according to manufacturer lubrication schedule
- [ ] **Inspect and service avionics systems** - Check navigation, communication, and electrical systems for proper operation while cleaning and inspecting connections
- [ ] **Service hydraulic and pneumatic systems** - Check fluid levels, filter condition, and system operation while replacing consumable items per maintenance schedule
- [ ] **Examine structural components** - Inspect critical structural areas, attachment points, and high-stress components for cracks, corrosion, or wear

### Compliance and Documentation Tasks

- [ ] **Complete required inspections** - Perform all inspection items specified in manufacturer maintenance program for current maintenance interval
- [ ] **Update airworthiness directive compliance** - Review and complete any recurring airworthiness directive requirements due at maintenance interval
- [ ] **Document all maintenance actions** - Record detailed descriptions of all work performed, parts installed, and findings in aircraft maintenance logbooks
- [ ] **Prepare maintenance release** - Complete required logbook entries certifying maintenance completion and aircraft return to service authorization

### Quality Control and Testing

- [ ] **Conduct operational system tests** - Verify proper operation of all systems affected by maintenance work through ground testing and functional checks
- [ ] **Perform final inspection** - Complete systematic review of all maintenance work to ensure compliance with specifications and quality standards
- [ ] **Update maintenance tracking records** - Enter completed maintenance items and next due dates in aircraft maintenance tracking system
- [ ] **Coordinate aircraft delivery** - Schedule aircraft return with client and provide summary of completed maintenance and any recommended future actions

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Scheduled maintenance completed within manufacturer recommended time limits.
**Quality Standard:** 100% compliance with manufacturer maintenance program requirements and procedures.
**Safety Standard:** Zero maintenance-related discrepancies discovered during post-maintenance inspection.
**Client Satisfaction:** 95% client approval rating for maintenance quality and communication throughout process.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Discovery of additional maintenance requirements during scheduled maintenance execution
**Solution:** Implement thorough pre-maintenance inspections, maintain current technical references, and establish clear client communication protocols for scope changes

**Issue:** Parts quality or availability issues affecting scheduled maintenance completion
**Solution:** Maintain approved vendor relationships, establish minimum stock levels for scheduled maintenance items, and implement expedited ordering procedures

**Issue:** Maintenance timeline extensions due to unexpected complexity or access requirements
**Solution:** Build realistic time estimates into maintenance scheduling, maintain contingency time for complex tasks, and communicate delays immediately to clients

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING:** Never defer or skip manufacturer-required maintenance tasks without proper regulatory approval and documentation

⚡ **CAUTION:** Ensure all maintenance work is performed by appropriately certified technicians using approved procedures and materials

ℹ️ **NOTE:** All scheduled maintenance must be completed and documented before aircraft return to service

✅ **BEST PRACTICE:** Follow manufacturer maintenance programs exactly as specified to maintain warranty coverage and optimal aircraft reliability
