## Process Steps

### Pre-Fueling Safety Phase

- **Verify aircraft electrical systems** - Ensure all electrical systems, radios, and transponders are turned off before beginning fuel operations
- **Check weather conditions** - Confirm wind speed is below 35 knots and no thunderstorms are within 5 miles of airport
- **Inspect fueling equipment** - Verify fuel truck, hoses, nozzles, and grounding equipment are in proper working condition
- **Review fuel requirements** - Confirm fuel type (100LL or Jet A), quantity requested, and any special handling instructions
- **Establish communication** - Contact pilot or aircraft owner to confirm fueling authorization and requirements
- **Position fuel truck safely** - Park fuel truck in designated position with emergency equipment accessible

### Grounding and Bonding Phase

- **Connect grounding cable** - Attach grounding cable from fuel truck to designated aircraft grounding point before fuel cap removal
- **Verify proper connection** - Ensure grounding cable makes solid electrical contact with aircraft structure
- **Test continuity** - Use continuity tester to verify proper grounding connection between truck and aircraft
- **Maintain grounding** - Keep grounding connection in place throughout entire fueling operation
- **Document grounding** - Record grounding verification on fuel service record
- **Check static dissipation** - Allow minimum 30 seconds for static electricity dissipation before fuel cap removal

### Fuel Quality Verification Phase

- **Sample fuel quality** - Draw fuel sample from truck tank and test for contamination, water, and proper fuel type
- **Check fuel color** - Verify 100LL is blue and Jet A is clear or straw-colored
- **Test for water contamination** - Use water detection paste or electronic tester to check for water presence
- **Verify fuel specifications** - Confirm fuel meets ASTM specifications for octane rating and additives
- **Document fuel quality** - Record fuel quality test results on fuel service record
- **Reject contaminated fuel** - Do not dispense fuel if contamination is detected; notify fuel supplier immediately

### Fueling Operation Phase

- **Remove fuel caps carefully** - Open fuel caps slowly to prevent static electricity buildup
- **Insert fuel nozzle properly** - Ensure fuel nozzle is fully inserted and seated in fuel port
- **Monitor fuel flow rate** - Maintain appropriate fuel flow rate to prevent overflow and static buildup
- **Watch for fuel level** - Monitor fuel quantity gauges and visual indicators to prevent overfilling
- **Maintain constant supervision** - Never leave fueling operation unattended; maintain visual contact at all times
- **Communicate with pilot** - Keep pilot informed of fueling progress and any issues that arise

### Post-Fueling Safety Phase

- **Secure fuel caps** - Replace and tighten fuel caps properly to prevent fuel leakage
- **Remove grounding cable** - Disconnect grounding cable only after all fuel caps are secured
- **Inspect for leaks** - Check aircraft and ground area for any fuel leaks or spills
- **Clean up work area** - Remove any fuel residue and dispose of contaminated materials properly
- **Complete documentation** - Fill out fuel service record with quantities, fuel type, and safety verification
- **Return equipment** - Secure fuel truck and equipment in designated storage areas

### Spill Response Phase

- **Stop fueling immediately** - Cease fuel flow and secure fuel source to prevent additional spillage
- **Eliminate ignition sources** - Ensure no smoking, electrical equipment, or vehicle engines in spill area
- **Contain fuel spill** - Use absorbent materials to contain and prevent spread of fuel spill
- **Ventilate area** - Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent vapor accumulation
- **Notify authorities** - Contact fire department and environmental authorities for spills exceeding reportable quantities
- **Document incident** - Complete spill report with cause, quantity, and response actions taken

---

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Standard fueling operation completed within 30 minutes for typical general aviation aircraft.
**Quality Standard:** Zero fuel contamination incidents and 100% fuel quality verification compliance.
**Safety Standard:** Zero fuel spills, fires, or safety incidents during fueling operations.
**Client Satisfaction:** Maintain client confidence through professional and safe fuel service delivery.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Static electricity buildup during fuel transfer
**Solution:** Ensure proper grounding, maintain slower fuel flow rates, and allow adequate static dissipation time

**Issue:** Fuel contamination detected in aircraft tanks
**Solution:** Stop fueling immediately, drain contaminated fuel, investigate source, and notify fuel supplier

**Issue:** Fuel spill during transfer operations
**Solution:** Implement immediate spill response procedures, contain spill, eliminate ignition sources, and notify appropriate authorities

---

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Never fuel aircraft with engines running, electrical systems on, or personnel smoking within 50 feet

⚠️ **WARNING**: Maintain proper grounding throughout entire fueling operation to prevent static electricity ignition

⚡ **CAUTION**: Check weather conditions before fueling; do not fuel during thunderstorms or high winds

⚡ **CAUTION**: Verify fuel type matches aircraft requirements; wrong fuel type can cause engine damage or failure

ℹ️ **NOTE**: Always maintain fire extinguisher within immediate reach during all fueling operations

✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct daily fuel quality testing and maintain detailed fuel service records for regulatory compliance
