**Client Satisfaction:** Transparent communication maintained with affected students and families throughout process.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Delayed incident reporting due to uncertainty about reporting requirements
**Solution:** Provide clear incident reporting training to all team members and establish "when in doubt, report" policy

**Issue:** Inadequate incident investigation due to limited investigation experience
**Solution:** Partner with experienced safety professionals and provide investigation training for key personnel

**Issue:** Resistance to reporting incidents due to fear of blame or punishment
**Solution:** Establish non-punitive safety reporting culture focused on learning and improvement rather than blame

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: All safety incidents must be reported immediately regardless of severity to ensure proper investigation and regulatory compliance

⚡ **CAUTION**: Preserve all incident-related evidence and documentation until investigation is complete and regulatory requirements are met

ℹ️ **NOTE**: Maintain confidentiality of incident investigations while ensuring appropriate information sharing for safety improvement
