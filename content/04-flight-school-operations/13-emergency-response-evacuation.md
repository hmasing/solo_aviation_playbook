## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Emergency response initiated within 2 minutes of emergency detection.
**Quality Standard:** 100% of persons safely evacuated and accounted for during emergency drills.
**Safety Standard:** All emergency response actions prioritize life safety over property protection.
**Client Satisfaction:** Students and team members feel prepared and confident in emergency procedures.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Confusion during evacuation due to inadequate training or unclear procedures
**Solution:** Conduct regular emergency drills and provide clear evacuation route marking and training

**Issue:** Inability to account for all persons during evacuation due to incomplete attendance records
**Solution:** Maintain current attendance records and assign specific accountability responsibilities to instructors

**Issue:** Delayed emergency response due to communication system failures
**Solution:** Implement redundant communication systems and train team members in backup notification procedures

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Never attempt emergency response actions that exceed your training or put your safety at risk

⚡ **CAUTION**: Ensure all emergency equipment is properly maintained and accessible during emergency situations

ℹ️ **NOTE**: Coordinate with local emergency services for facility-specific emergency response planning and training
