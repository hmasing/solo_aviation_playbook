# Aircraft Maintenance and Inspection

Maintain training aircraft airworthiness through systematic maintenance and inspection programs to ensure safe flight operations and regulatory compliance.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Purpose

Establish procedures for coordinating training aircraft maintenance, conducting required inspections, and maintaining airworthiness documentation to ensure safe flight training operations while minimizing aircraft downtime and training disruptions.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Maintenance Coordinator:**

- Schedule and coordinate all aircraft maintenance activities with flight training operations
- Monitor aircraft maintenance status and airworthiness compliance
- Maintain maintenance records and coordinate with certified mechanics
- Communicate aircraft availability status to flight scheduling team

**Chief Flight Instructor:**

- Review and approve aircraft grounding decisions for maintenance issues
- Coordinate training schedule adjustments for planned maintenance activities
- Ensure flight instructors report aircraft discrepancies properly
- Verify aircraft airworthiness before authorizing training flights

**Flight Instructor:**

- Conduct thorough pre-flight inspections before each training flight
- Document aircraft discrepancies and maintenance issues immediately
- Brief students on aircraft systems and inspection procedures
- Coordinate with maintenance team for aircraft status updates

**Student Pilot:**

- Participate in pre-flight inspection procedures under instructor supervision
- Report any observed aircraft discrepancies to flight instructor immediately
- Complete aircraft inspection checklists as part of training requirements
- Maintain awareness of aircraft limitations and operational requirements

## Process Steps

### Daily Aircraft Status Review Phase

- [ ] **Review maintenance status** - Check aircraft logbooks and maintenance tracking system for currency
- [ ] **Verify inspection compliance** - Confirm annual, 100-hour, and other required inspections are current
- [ ] **Check discrepancy reports** - Review any reported aircraft issues from previous flights
- [ ] **Coordinate maintenance scheduling** - Plan maintenance activities to minimize training disruptions

### Pre-Flight Inspection Phase

- [ ] **Conduct pre-flight inspection** - Complete systematic aircraft inspection using approved checklist
- [ ] **Review aircraft logbooks** - Verify airworthiness certificate, registration, and required inspections
- [ ] **Check fuel and oil levels** - Confirm adequate fuel quantity and oil levels for planned flight
- [ ] **Test aircraft systems** - Verify proper operation of all required systems and equipment

### Post-Flight Documentation Phase

- [ ] **Complete post-flight inspection** - Conduct post-flight aircraft inspection for new discrepancies
- [ ] **Document flight time** - Record accurate flight time in aircraft logbooks and maintenance records
- [ ] **Report discrepancies** - Document any observed aircraft issues or maintenance needs
- [ ] **Update maintenance tracking** - Record flight hours and schedule upcoming maintenance requirements

### Maintenance Coordination Phase

- [ ] **Schedule required maintenance** - Coordinate maintenance activities with certified mechanics
- [ ] **Manage aircraft downtime** - Minimize training schedule disruption during maintenance periods
- [ ] **Verify maintenance completion** - Review completed maintenance work and required documentation
- [ ] **Return aircraft to service** - Conduct airworthiness review and authorize return to training operations

## Tools and Resources

**Inspection Equipment:**

- Aircraft-specific inspection checklists
- Maintenance logbooks and documentation
- Pre-flight inspection tools and equipment
- Aircraft systems testing equipment

**Documentation Systems:**

- Aircraft maintenance tracking system
- Flight time recording system
- Discrepancy reporting forms
- Maintenance work order system

**Reference Materials:**

- Aircraft maintenance manuals and service bulletins
- Federal Aviation Regulations Part 91 and Part 43
- Aircraft inspection requirements and intervals
- Approved maintenance provider contact information

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Aircraft discrepancies reported within 1 hour of discovery.
**Quality Standard:** 100% of required inspections completed before expiration dates.
**Safety Standard:** Zero training flights conducted with unairworthy aircraft.
**Client Satisfaction:** Less than 5% of scheduled lessons cancelled due to aircraft maintenance issues.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Unexpected aircraft discrepancies disrupting scheduled training flights
**Solution:** Maintain backup aircraft availability and implement rapid discrepancy assessment procedures to minimize training disruptions

**Issue:** Maintenance scheduling conflicts with peak training demand periods
**Solution:** Schedule routine maintenance during low-demand periods and coordinate with flight school scheduler for advance planning

**Issue:** Student pilot uncertainty about pre-flight inspection procedures
**Solution:** Provide thorough pre-flight inspection training and maintain standardized inspection checklists for each aircraft type

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Never authorize flight operations with aircraft that have unresolved airworthiness discrepancies or expired inspections

⚡ **CAUTION**: Ensure all maintenance work is performed by appropriately certified mechanics and properly documented in aircraft logbooks

ℹ️ **NOTE**: Aircraft must be grounded immediately upon discovery of any condition that affects airworthiness or flight safety

✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct pre-flight inspections in adequate lighting conditions and allow sufficient time for thorough inspection
