# Avionics Operations

## Chapter Overview

Avionics operations represent specialized maintenance, repair, and installation services for aircraft electronic systems. Operating under Part 145 Repair Station certification requirements, these procedures ensure compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations while maintaining the highest standards of safety and quality in electronic system integration and support.

This chapter contains **15 specialized procedures** covering the complete spectrum of avionics services from initial work authorization through emergency Aircraft on Ground (AOG) support. Each procedure addresses the unique requirements of electronic systems integration, regulatory compliance, and quality assurance specific to modern avionics equipment.

### Operational Scope

Our avionics operations encompass advanced electronic systems and equipment:

**Communication Systems:**

- VHF communication radio installation and repair
- Transponder and ADS-B system maintenance and testing
- Emergency locator transmitter (ELT) services
- Intercom and audio panel integration

**Navigation Equipment:**

- GPS and WAAS-capable navigation systems
- VOR and ILS navigation equipment
- Distance measuring equipment (DME) services
- Flight management system (FMS) programming and support

**Flight Instruments:**

- Glass cockpit displays and integration
- Electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS)
- Primary and multifunction displays
- Engine monitoring and alerting systems

**Safety and Warning Systems:**

- Traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS)
