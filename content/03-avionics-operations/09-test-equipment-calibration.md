## Process Steps

### Calibration Planning and Scheduling Phase

- **Establish calibration schedules** - Determine calibration intervals based on manufacturer recommendations and usage requirements
- **Identify calibration requirements** - Review equipment specifications and determine required calibration parameters and tolerances
- **Select calibration providers** - Choose qualified calibration laboratories with appropriate certifications and capabilities
- **Schedule calibration services** - Coordinate calibration timing to minimize operational impact while maintaining compliance

### Pre-Calibration Preparation Phase

- **Review equipment condition** - Inspect equipment for damage or conditions that might affect calibration accuracy
- **Gather calibration history** - Review previous calibration records and identify any recurring issues or trends
- **Prepare equipment for shipment** - Package equipment properly for transport to calibration facility
- **Document equipment status** - Record equipment condition and last use before calibration service

### Calibration Service Coordination Phase

- **Ship equipment for calibration** - Coordinate with calibration laboratory for equipment receipt and service scheduling
- **Monitor calibration progress** - Track calibration status and coordinate with laboratory for any issues or delays
- **Review calibration results** - Examine calibration certificates and test results for compliance and accuracy
- **Process out-of-tolerance conditions** - Evaluate impact of any out-of-tolerance conditions on previous measurements

### Post-Calibration Processing Phase

- **Update calibration records** - Enter calibration data into equipment tracking system and update calibration status
- **Apply calibration labels** - Attach current calibration labels showing calibration date and next due date
- **Return equipment to service** - Make calibrated equipment available for operational use with updated status

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Equipment calibration completed within scheduled intervals with zero overdue items.
**Quality Standard:** 98% of equipment passes calibration within specifications on first attempt.
**Safety Standard:** All test equipment maintains required accuracy for safety-critical measurements.
**Client Satisfaction:** Zero measurement errors or quality issues due to equipment calibration problems.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Test equipment fails calibration or shows out-of-tolerance conditions
**Solution:** Evaluate impact on previous measurements and work performed, implement corrective actions for affected work if required, and consider equipment replacement if recurring calibration failures occur

**Issue:** Calibration schedules not maintained resulting in overdue equipment
**Solution:** Implement automated calibration reminder systems, establish backup equipment for critical functions, and coordinate calibration schedules with operational requirements to prevent disruptions

**Issue:** High calibration costs affecting budget and operational efficiency
**Solution:** Evaluate equipment utilization and consider consolidating similar capabilities, negotiate volume discounts with calibration providers, and implement preventive maintenance to extend calibration intervals

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Never use test equipment that is overdue for calibration or shows questionable accuracy as inaccurate measurements may result in unsafe aircraft conditions

⚡ **CAUTION**: Handle calibration equipment carefully during transport and storage to prevent damage that could affect accuracy

ℹ️ **NOTE**: All test equipment must maintain traceability to national standards through accredited calibration laboratories

✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Maintain backup equipment for critical functions to ensure continuous operations during calibration periods
