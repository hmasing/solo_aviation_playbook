## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Standard parts orders processed and received within supplier lead time plus 10% buffer.
**Quality Standard:** 98% parts availability for scheduled maintenance with zero counterfeit or non-conforming parts accepted.
**Safety Standard:** 100% parts traceability maintained from procurement through installation.
**Client Satisfaction:** Zero maintenance delays due to parts availability issues for scheduled work.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Critical parts not available when needed causing maintenance delays
**Solution:** Implement minimum stock levels for critical parts, establish emergency procurement procedures with expedited suppliers, and maintain alternate source approvals for high-usage components

**Issue:** Counterfeit or non-conforming parts received from suppliers
**Solution:** Verify supplier authorization and quality certifications, conduct thorough incoming inspection procedures, and maintain relationships only with approved and audited suppliers

**Issue:** Parts shelf life expiration causing inventory waste and additional costs
**Solution:** Implement first-in-first-out inventory rotation procedures, monitor shelf life dates systematically, and coordinate with suppliers for just-in-time delivery of time-sensitive components

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Use only approved parts from authorized sources as counterfeit or non-conforming parts may fail and create unsafe flight conditions

⚡ **CAUTION**: Maintain proper ESD protection for all electronic components during storage and handling to prevent damage

ℹ️ **NOTE**: All parts must maintain complete traceability documentation from manufacture through installation to support warranty claims and regulatory requirements

✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Establish long-term relationships with authorized suppliers to ensure reliable parts availability and quality support
