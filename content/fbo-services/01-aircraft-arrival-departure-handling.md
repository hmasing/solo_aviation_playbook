# Aircraft Arrival and Departure Handling

Provide handling services for arriving and departing aircraft to ensure safe, efficient, and professional client experience.

## Purpose

This process establishes procedures for managing general aviation aircraft arrivals and departures to ensure safe ground operations, quality client experience, and efficient ramp utilization while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational excellence. Our 3,500-foot runway accommodates aircraft such as Cessna 172, Piper Cherokee, King Air, Pilatus, and TBM series aircraft.

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Line Service Technician:**

- Provide direct aircraft handling services
- Execute safety protocols during aircraft movements
- Document all services provided accurately
- Coordinate with ground support equipment
- Monitor safety compliance during operations

**Client Service Representative:**

- Manage client communications and service requests
- Process documentation and billing
- Obtain client authorizations and approvals
- Coordinate scheduling and aircraft availability
- Maintain professional client relationships

**Operations Leader:**

- Oversee daily operations and coordinate between departments
- Authorize emergency response procedures and resource allocation
- Monitor safety compliance and operational excellence
- Coordinate scheduling across departments for operational coverage
- Review billing disputes and approve service adjustments
- Ensure regulatory compliance across all operations

## Process Steps

### Pre-Arrival Phase

- **Review flight plan information** - Confirm aircraft type, arrival time, and special requirements
- **Verify ramp space availability** - Check assigned parking position and clearance requirements
- **Prepare ground support equipment** - Position required equipment and verify operational status
- **Monitor aircraft approach** - Track inbound aircraft progress via radio communications and ATC coordination

### Aircraft Arrival Phase

- **Set up marshalling position** - Position equipment and personnel with proper safety gear and communication devices
- **Guide aircraft to parking** - Provide visual marshalling signals using standard hand signals for precise positioning
- **Conduct initial safety assessment** - Verify aircraft position, chock placement, and equipment positioning
- **Greet clients professionally** - Welcome clients and assess immediate service needs (fuel, ground power, passenger services)

### Service Coordination Phase

- **Document service requests** - Record all requested services and coordinate timing with team members and vendors
- **Monitor service progress** - Maintain client communication regarding timing and operational updates
- **Coordinate ongoing services** - Ensure efficient delivery of fuel, maintenance, catering, and other requested services

### Pre-Departure Phase

- **Confirm service completion** - Verify all services are completed and documented for billing
- **Coordinate departure timing** - Communicate with clients regarding departure requirements and timing
- **Prepare for engine start** - Remove ground support equipment and conduct final safety inspection
- **Provide fire guard services** - Monitor engine start for safety concerns and irregularities

### Departure Phase

- **Guide aircraft to taxiway** - Provide marshalling signals for safe taxi using appropriate safety protocols
- **Complete final documentation** - Update service records, billing information, and operational notes
- **Reset ramp area** - Clear and inspect parking area, return equipment to storage, prepare for next aircraft
- **Conduct service follow-up** - Contact clients post-departure for feedback and coordinate future services

## Process Mapping

Flowchart showing sequential steps from aircraft approach monitoring through post-departure follow-up with decision points for service coordination and safety assessments.

## Tools and Resources

- Aircraft marshalling wands and safety equipment
- Ground support equipment (chocks, cones, fire extinguisher)
- Radio communication equipment and frequency references
- Service request forms and billing documentation systems
- Weather monitoring equipment and runway condition reports
- Emergency contact lists and safety protocol references

## Success Metrics

**Completion Time:** Aircraft handling process completed within 15 minutes of arrival.
**Quality Standard:** Zero safety incidents and 100% client satisfaction with arrival/departure experience.
**Safety Standard:** All ground operations completed without FOD incidents or equipment damage.
**Client Satisfaction:** 95% or higher client satisfaction rating for arrival and departure services.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Training aircraft (Cessna 172) arrives during peak flight school operations with limited parking space
**Solution:** Coordinate with operations leader for alternative parking assignments and communicate revised timing to flight instructor

**Issue:** Ground support equipment malfunction during critical service period
**Solution:** Implement backup equipment protocols and coordinate with maintenance team for immediate repair or replacement

**Issue:** Weather conditions affect safe marshalling operations
**Solution:** Activate adverse weather procedures, use alternative communication methods, and coordinate with air traffic control for timing adjustments

## Safety Considerations

- ⚠️ **WARNING**: Maintain minimum 25-foot clearance from operating aircraft engines and propellers at all times
- ⚡ **CAUTION**: Verify aircraft parking brake engagement and proper chock placement before approaching aircraft
- ℹ️ **NOTE**: Monitor weather conditions and wind direction during all marshalling operations
- ✅ **BEST PRACTICE**: Conduct pre-shift briefing on current NOTAMs, runway conditions, and operational priorities
